API:Suomi 2.0 Requirements
============

This document is a lightweight requirements documentation for {API:Suomi} 2.0 service. 

## Driving idea: 
* HTML5/JQuery based frontend 
* which uses Node.js driven public and open API to pull and store data.  

## API features:
* Must be able to read RAML defined APIs to database from given api.json file in the web (preferably in Github repository)
* Return list of all APIs, paged 
* Add single API
* Remove single API
* Update single API fields
*
